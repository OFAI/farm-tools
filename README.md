# farm-tools
Programs, library functions, tools working on top of deepset-ai's FARM


My own code for using the FARM library, chaotic, some parts may be out of date.

Contains modified modules from the FARM package to make some of the things I needed work.

License of this code is the same as for the FARM software.
